## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an AI-powered trading agent that operates across **Solana** (SPL token ecosystem, Serum/DEX swaps) and **Bitcoin** (via Lightning & on-chain data).  

We move from **manual trading** to **automated bots**, and finally to **AI agents** powered by fine-tuned machine learning models.  

### Core Features
- **Cross-chain trading**: Supports **Solana SPL tokens** and **Bitcoin transactions**
- **AI-driven decisions**: Fine-tuned local language models for strategy execution
- **Local-first design**: Maximal privacy and control, minimal external dependencies
- **Synthetic data & RL**: GAN-generated trading data + reinforcement learning optimizations
- **Research-focused**: Transparency, reproducibility, and modular design

## 📊 Development Pipeline

The trading agent evolves in **3 stages**:

1. **Manual Trading**

   * Execute swaps manually on Solana DEX / Bitcoin testnet
   * Gain familiarity with raw blockchain mechanics

2. **Bot Automation**

   * Scripted trading bots for BTC/USDT and SOL/USDC pairs
   * Programmatic swaps via RPC

3. **AI Agents**

   * Intelligent decision-making with LLMs
   * Memory-enabled agents adapt to market conditions
   * Reinforcement learning strategies
